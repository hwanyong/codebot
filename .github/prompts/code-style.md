# Codebot Code Style Guide

## Error Handling

1. **Avoid Global Try-Catch**: Don't use global try-catch blocks to suppress exceptions. Handle errors at the appropriate level.
2. **Fail Fast**: Detect errors early and handle them appropriately within each responsible component.
3. **Error Boundaries**: Structure code with proper error boundaries to prevent silent failures and maintain clear responsibility.
4. **Domain-Specific Errors**: Use custom error classes that extend from a base error class for different types of errors.
5. **Contextual Errors**: Include relevant context information in error messages and error objects.
6. **Graceful Recovery**: When handling errors, provide meaningful responses and allow the system to continue operating when possible.

## Code Structure

1. **Early Returns**: Use early returns to avoid deeply nested conditional statements.
2. **Avoid "If Hell"**: Prevent deeply nested conditional statements by extracting logic into separate functions.
3. **Clean Async Code**: Keep asynchronous code clean and manageable by using proper async/await patterns.
4. **Input Validation**: Validate inputs at the function entry points.
5. **Typed Interfaces**: Use TypeScript interfaces to define clear contracts between components.

## Naming Conventions

1. **Underscore for Private Fields**: Use underscore prefix for private field names in TypeScript.
2. **Descriptive Names**: Use descriptive names that convey intention for variables, functions, and classes.
3. **Consistent Naming**: Maintain consistency in naming across the codebase.

## Documentation

1. **Function Comments**: Include JSDoc comments for functions describing parameters and return values.
2. **Class Comments**: Document classes with their purpose and usage.
3. **Bilingual Comments**: Provide comments in both English and Korean where applicable.
4. **Generated Code**: Add a comment 'Generated by Copilot' to all generated code.

## Testing

1. **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for core functionality.
2. **Error Cases**: Include tests for error cases to ensure proper error handling.

## Performance

1. **Async Operations**: Use async/await for asynchronous operations.
2. **Resource Management**: Properly manage resources, especially in error cases.
