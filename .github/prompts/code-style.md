Please write code that avoids using a global try-catch block to suppress all exceptions. Instead, apply the Fail Fast principle and Error Handling patterns to detect errors early and handle them appropriately within each responsible component. Additionally, structure the code with proper error boundaries to prevent silent failures and maintain clear responsibility for error handling. Make sure to prevent "if hell" by avoiding deeply nested conditional statements, eliminate "callback hell" by keeping asynchronous code clean and manageable, and improve readability with early returns where appropriate.
